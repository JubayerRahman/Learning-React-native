## Hi this is my course planning, Updates and tracking


This repo is to keep track of my react native course progress. this repo has overall 19 sections with almost 220 videos. So my plan is simple: I plan to see at least 8 videos daily and practice them. 

And below here I will keep a track of the sections like what was the section about and What I learnt form them 

## Section 01: This is the introduction section

This section has 20 videos so according to my plan it will take me 3 days  2 and a half to be exact to complete this part but if I get lucky I might complete it within 2 days.

### Update: 
 - I officially started and completed 4% of the course as planned and viewed 8 videos so far it was a good experience. learned a lot about typescript. Looking forward to learning more

 ### Update 2:
 - I have learned a lot today the highlight of today's learning was learning about MongoDB Compass and PostMan I also have learned some new techniques for the backend. completed 8% of the course excited to learn more in the future

 ## Section 18: The system setup (Windows)

I was facing some trouble to use the system so today I completed this section and added the sytems and software for the course.

## Section 02: This Section is for error handelling

This section is small it has 4 videos and around 30 min watch time I will complet it with the section 1 I mean in the mentiond 3 days but if only if i stumbled in any issue thats why I am consedering to give it one day.
